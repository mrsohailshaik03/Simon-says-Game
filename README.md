# Simon-says-Game

This commit adds the Simon Says game to the repository. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an interactive experience where players must follow a sequence of flashing colors.

Key features of the Simon Says game:
- A user interface built with HTML and CSS for a clean and responsive design.
- JavaScript is used to implement the game logic, including generating random color sequences, handling user input, and managing game progression.
- Visual feedback for each step, with the colors flashing to guide the player.
- A scalable design, allowing the game to be played across multiple devices and screen sizes.

This project demonstrates the integration of front-end technologies to create a fun and interactive game, highlighting event handling, timing functions, and user interface management.
